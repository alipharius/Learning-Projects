# Learning Projects

My personal coding playground where I experiment, learn, and build small things.

## What's Here
- **Learning experiments** - Trying out new concepts
- **Quick tools** - Utilities I actually use  
- **Tutorial projects** - Following along with courses
- **Half-baked ideas** - Experiments that might turn into something bigger

## Current Focus
- Python scripting and automation
- Data analysis basics
- Building practical tools

## For Visitors
This is my learning space, not a polished portfolio. Code quality varies, ideas evolve, and sometimes things break. That's how learning works!

*Learning through practical projects*
